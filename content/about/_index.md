<!-- <img style=" display: flex; object-fit: cover; height: 250px; width: 250px;" src="me.jpg"/> -->
I'm a photographer passionate about keeping traditional, analogue photography practices alive.

I'm a UX designer, a computer networking grad and a web development postgrad.

I'm a multi-instrumental musician. 

I'm passionate about vintage technology and it's preservation.

I'm also multilingual. I have varying levels of skill in many languages, though English, Dutch and Scots are what I am most comfortable communicating in.
