I'm originally from a wee bit outside Glasgow, Scotland, but I'm now based in Edinburgh.

I'm a cybersec/sysadmin by day, though I've got an honours degree in computer networking, and a postgrad in web development.
<br><br>
I'm a photographer who's passionate about keeping traditional, analogue photography practices alive. I usually focus on architecture and the beauty of the natural world. 
<br><br>
I'm a musician. When people ask me what I can play, I sometimes think it'd be easier to answer what I **can't** play. These days, guitar and bass are my main focus, and I'm trying to teach myself clarinet.
<br><br>
I'm passionate about the preservation of vintage tech - the real life translation being that my house is full of old, probably broken things.
<br><br>
I'm mildly obsessed with languages. I speak Scots, English and Dutch (you can contact me in any of these), and have varying skills in a bunch of other languages. Feel free to challenge me with a language of your choice!
