In May/June 2019, I spent a few weeks in Norway exploring the cities and surroundings of Bergen, on the south-west coast, and Tromsø, in the Arctic. 

The images here I feel really embody so many of the things that Norway is to me; from it's landscape, to it's culture, it's past and it's blessing of the summer midnight sun in its far north. 

There's a reason it's one of my favourite places in the whole world.  

All photos were shot with my Olympus OM2n with either Fujifilm Sensia 100, Fujifilm Pro 400H, Fujifilm Neopan 400, Kodak Portra 400 or Ilford Delta 400 film.
