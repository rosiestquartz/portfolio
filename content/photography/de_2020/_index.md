I spent a few days visiting a friend in Leipzig, Germany in August 2020. This is a collection of some of my 
favourite images I captured of the sights we saw together during that trip. 

(All social distancing and other COVID-19-related restrictions were obeyed during this trip).

All images were captured on Kodak Portra 400, Fujifilm C200 and Ilford Delta 400 film.
