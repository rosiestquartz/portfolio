I took part in a film photography community event called "Expired Film Day" on twitter in March 2019. The aim was to 
spend the day shooting with film that had passed its "Process Before" date and working with the challenges it 
presents, with the possibility of prizes for the best photos of the day. 

All photos were shot on Fujifilm NPS 160 Professional film (expired in 2005) with my Yashica Mat-124G and 
Rolleinar #2 close-up filter.
