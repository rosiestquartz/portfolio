When I first started seriously shooting on film, I was a teenager with rather little disposable income. As a result, my choices of what films to use was rather limited.

One film I could afford was Fuji's Superia 200, and I fell in love with it after getting my first roll back. And oh boy did I shoot a lot of it from then on.

It was slightly cheaper and much easier to get than their Superia Reala 100, yet had many of the same qualities; deep reds, vivid greens, sharp, low grain and a slightly warm glow to everything. It embodied so much of what I thought of when I thought of colour film photography.

Unfortunately, by the time I returned to photography in my adulthood in 2017, it had been axed by Fuji. 

However, one day on a trip down to Irvine in Ayrshire in 2018, I wandered into Boots just to see what they still offered in their photo section, if anything. To my amazement, there was one singular roll of Superia 200 buried at the back of the shelf - and it was in date!

In early autumn that year I loaded it into my freshly serviced Olympus OM-10 and spent some time in Kelvingrove Park and Pollok Park in Glasgow, hoping to capture the beauty of my favourite season on my favourite film for the last time.
