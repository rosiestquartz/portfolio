I **adore** the 2007 video game Mirrors Edge. The city in which it is set is such a cold, sterile, intimidating yet familiar feeling place, where the white, grey and glass of the cityscape are contrasted so beautifully with a clear blue sky and bright blocks of primary colours. 

In January 2020 I decided to go for a walk in Glasgow, starting in the glass-clad office building filled western side of the city centre, looking to capture some of the Mirrors Edge vibe that I so often get in this part of the city. Despite it being a freezing cold and rather grey day, the city did not disappoint.
